# ukcrime

In Last 3 years the meaning of living a normal life has changed. The world which was used to hug and shake hands, moved to social distancing and elbow fists. To say, “The Pandemic has changed the world”, would be an understatement. It has reduced the impersonal meeting and increased the virtual existence of humans on internet. Pandemic has imposed the restrictions on everyday lives, thus effecting the people behavior. Pandemic has also affected the crime rates. In this study we intend to find the effects of covid on frequency of crime rates (includes violence, theft, murder, home abuse) in the United Kingdom (UK). Particularly, we will study the shift of crimes from one form to another across different states before and after covid. Secondly, we also want to figure out what are the factors which decide the outcome of the crime offender. We expect to use various data science visualizations techniques from analyzing the patterns of form & frequency change of crimes. For figuring out factors responsible for the outcomes of felony we intend to use various statistical Machine Learning, Statistical and Probabilistic techniques.
